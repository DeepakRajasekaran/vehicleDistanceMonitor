# vehicleDistanceMonitor

This project uses a [YOLOv4-tiny](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov4/tree/master/models/yolov4-tiny) object detection model to detect vehicles on the road and alert the driver if they are too close.

## Features

* Detects vehicles of different classes, including cars, trucks, and buses.
* Can be used to detect vehicles in real time from camera input for simulation purpose pre-recorded videos are used.
* Can be used in self-driving cars or other applications.

## Benefits

* Helps to prevent accidents by alerting drivers to the presence of close objects.
* Can improve the safety of self-driving cars.
* Can be used to collect data on vehicle behavior.

## Usage

The system can be used by self-driving cars, driver assistance systems, or anyone who wants to detect vehicles in their environment.

To use the system, you will need to install the [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/) and the YOLOv4-tiny model. You can then run the [Python script](https://github.com/DeepakRajasekaran/vehicleDistanceMoniter/blob/main/vehicleDistanceAlert.py) to detect vehicles in real time or in pre-recorded videos.
